# Memowee: Face Recognition System for Dementia Patient Care

Repository: https://github.com/xelpaxu/Memowee

## Overview

Memowee is a deep-learning–based face recognition system that helps dementia patients recognize familiar people by identifying pre‑registered faces and showing their name, relationship, and a short description on screen. It uses a Siamese convolutional neural network trained from scratch on a subset of the VGGFace2 dataset to learn compact face embeddings and compare them using Euclidean distance, providing reliable same‑person vs. different‑person decisions for registered profiles.
